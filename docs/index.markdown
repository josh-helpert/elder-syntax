Elder syntax documentation is broken into a few parts.

## Syntax
[Syntax - Overview](./syntax) Read for an overview of the Elder syntax standard. Much how LISP uses S-expressions, this is separate from the Elder language which implements the syntax standard.

[Syntax - Learn by Example](./syntax-examples) Read to learn the Elder syntax standard using examples, counter examples, and how other languages compare to do the same tasks.
