## Section
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Notes
  * Used to break code into major sections
  * Needs way to handle:
    * conjunction tag
    * disjunction tag
    * nesting tag
      * like markdown headers and paragraphs?
    * way to export last statements to bind to variables like `x, y, z = ...`
      * how does this jive w/ the section syntax or are they orthogonal?
  *
