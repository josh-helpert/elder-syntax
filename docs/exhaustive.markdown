Scratch:
* Having a correct program requires:
  * All input predicates satisfied
  * All possible output handeled
    * Even exceptions, edge-cases, etc.
  * Will terminate
  * 
* Tools for exceptions, edge-cases, bounds, weird-cases, etc.
  * Provably correct
  * Doesn't matter
    * Becomes a noop so can exec like normal
    * Rollover or value doesn't matter
  * Optional Type a la Zig
  * Result Type (result or error) a la Zig, Rust
  * Signal/Indicate issue or gap which must be resolved by caller (or deferred to it's caller)
    * It must be resolved at some point eventually reaching to the context
    * 
  * 
* Process
  * Signal
  * Handle
  * Select/Pick or other?
