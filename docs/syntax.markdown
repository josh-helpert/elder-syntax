Elder syntax's goal is to unify homoiconic and data-oriented syntax structure as tersely as possible and ultimately create a general purpose syntax. Elder core language uses the Elder syntax as it's choice of syntax much like many LISP implementations use S-expressions for their syntax.

Elder syntax is a general purpose syntax which competes with a variety of syntax use-cases:
* homoiconic syntaxes like s-expressions, sweet-expressions, o-expressions, Rebol syntax
* serialization and data-modeling
  * external schema and types like StrictYAML
  * syntax and literal types like JSON, YAML, SDLang, OGDL
  * schema like InternetObject, OGDL
  * custom DSL like Pug, SASS, Markdown

Implementors decide the level of complexity of the syntax by opting into dialects that suite their needs. Currently these are the features one may include:
* base: Required for any implementation as it contains the basics of the syntax
* types and literals: Adds type-like constraints including types, interfaces, traits, etc. and some sugar to represent the most common data representations
* schema: Adds schema descriptions
* DSL: Adds syntax and sugar to create DSLs more easily
* exec: Adds remaining syntax and sugar to create a full language

For example, to emulate JSON you would need to incorporate ***base and literal*** while for a different approach to emulate OGDL you must incoporate ***base, literals, and schema***.

This document only describes the ***Elder syntax*** itself. It doesn't tell you about the ***semantics*** (meaning) of the syntax. The semantics are added once the syntax is used w/n a specific context. For example, a sequence within the context of a HTML document are HTML nodes. Clarifying the semantics and other language uses are part of the core language and not described here as they're beyond the scope of the syntax. However, to help, there are some examples with psuedo-code at the end.

## Sequence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A ***Sequence*** (much like LISP, Rebol) is a core syntactical structure. A sequence is:
* A ordered, series of elements
* A syntactical concept
* Not a List, Array, Series, Set, et al. b/c these all make more and different guarantees

There are multiple forms (syntactical layout) that are used and we will slowly build them up over this document.

The simplest is the multiline form:
```
x
y
z
```

### Inline Siblings
To write more compact code we have to introduce new syntax `,`
* Represents a sibling w/n a sequence
* Internally `,` translates into a `\n` so the two forms are equivalent
* For consistency and clarity, you can't mix inline and multiline syntax `,` for the same sequence

Using this, we can compact the sequence to:
```
x, y, z
```

### Sequences of Sequences
We can express sequences of sequences by combining the syntaxes:
```
a, b
c, d
e, f
```
This is read as:
* a sequence of 3 items
* each item is a sequence
* each item contains 2 elements

Inline siblings (like `a, b`) are higher precedence than `\n` siblings this represents a sequence of multiple sequences.
This is consistent b/c we don't allow mixing `,` and `\n` sibling syntaxes for the same siblings.

Multiline precedence is done this way as it follows the natural English reading order top-to-bottom then left-to-right.
We want our syntax to follow what one would expect so it's easier to predict.

## Tree
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A natural extension of a ***Sequence*** are ***Nested Sequences***. This is a ***Tree***.

A ***Tree*** is a primitive structure b/c:
* It's how code is naturally structured
* AST are modeled as trees which makes it easier for our code layout to match the expected syntax tree which make it more guessable and predictable

The multiline form (2 space `INDENT` represents a child):
```
x
  a
  b
  c
```
This code tells us that:
* `a, b, c` are children of `x` b/c they're nested under x w/ a 2 space `INDENT`
* `a, b, c` are siblings b/c they're at the same indendation level under the same parent

2 spaces are used b/c it's the minimal amount to make it clear there's indentation. No tabs, no variable spaces, nothing but 2 spaces per indentation. Later in this document there are ways to compact the syntax.

This can be nested arbitrarily and the structure matches what you expect as the layout matches the code layout:
```
x
  a
  b
    1
    2
    3
  c
```

### Multiple parents

When we say tree syntax it's really about describing the natural structure is tree like.

It's possible to describe data which isn't a tree like a graph:
```
a
b, c
  x
  y
  z
d
```

Notice that the syntax is still structurally a tree but we've described a graph as `b, c` are both the parents of `x, y, z`.

## Equals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Equals (`=`) is a syntax which captures the pattern of relating ***L-hand*** to a ***R-hand***.

The precise relationship between ***L-hand*** and ***R-hand*** varies with the context it's defined in (eg assignment, mapping between names and values, key-value entry)

We can model definition or assignment:
```
x = 1
```
This is read as:
* name `x` relates to value `1`

We can model a map:
```
obj
  a = 1
  b = 2
  c = 3
```
This is read as:
* name `obj` has 3 children
* the 1st child is `a = 1`
  * name `a` relates to value `1`
* the 2nd child is `b = 2`
  * name `b` relates to value `2`
* the 3rd child is `c = 3`
  * name `c` relates to value `3`

### Equals Newline
Sometimes it makes sense to not have the value on the same line as the `=`.

Essentially the child or children become the value of the R-hand of the expression.

There's a few cases where the values is:
* A single value
  ```
  x =
    a
  ```
  * This is equivalent to `x = a` since `a` is the only immediate child of `x`
  * Often useful when the value is a self-executing expression
* A single, complex value
  ```
  x =
    a
      b
      c
  ```
  * This associates `x` name to the structure starting with `a` since `a` is the only immediate child of `x`
  * Often useful when the value is a complex data-structure
* Multiple values
  ```
  x =
    a
    b
    c
  ```
  and equivalently:
  ```
  x
    =
      a
      b
      c
  ```
  * This is equivalent to `x = (a, b, c)`. This is b/c the sequence `a, b, c` are all immediate children of `x`
  * Often useful when you want to store a literal, multi-valued, container-like (eg `List`, `Sequence`, `Map`)

## Relator
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A ***Relator*** is a syntactical tool which models the ***relation*** between a ***target*** and a ***descriptor***. Customizing the syntax allows developers to add structure to the syntax without the need of macros (although more constrained than what macros provide).

To understand this concept better consider other languages which are often hard coded:
* `C++`
  * accessing a `Namespace` uses `::` and is used like `my_namespace::my_val`
  * accessing a `Struct` field uses `.` and is used like `my_stuct.field` or `my_struct.field = 1`
* `Clojure`
  * accessing a `Namespace` uses `/` and is used like `my_namespace/my_val`
  * interop with `Java` or `JavaScript` uses `.` and is used like `(.toUpperCase "jane")`

Functionally it works much like a **namespace** but:
* characters can only be specific punctuation
  * Unicode will eventually be supported, but for now only ASCII printable characters (32 - 126) minus whatever is reserved
* identifier characters and relator characters must not overlap b/c relators are used as delimiters between identifiers (like `a/b/c` where `/` is a relator)
* is more general concept than a namespace and can be used to model more patterns
* can be syntactically used in more ways
* it is a tree node
* If multiple relators have the same syntax, the longest match wins
  * For example, if both `:` and `::` are defined `::` will always win
  * This also means multiple characters can be combined to make new relators.
    * For example, if `:`, `.`, `/` are all relators then `:./` would form a new relator distinct from the others.

Although developers can define their own, there are 3 common relators that are commonly used:
* `/` the child relator for parent-child relation
  * Often used to represent child inline
  * Replaces indentation
* `.` the dot relator for object-property relation
  * Often used to represent properties or attributes of an object
* `:` the meta relator for data-metadata relation
  * used to represent metadata of any data (and since it's homoiconic it can target almost anything)
  * does the work of describing conceptsa like types, constraints, relative types, rules, etc.

For demonstration, let's use the object-property relation `.` syntax.

### Literal
In order to model data without additional syntactical noise, data can be written as literal trees. For relators, there's a few rules:
* When multiline, it must match the layout of a tree as described above.
* When inline, there must be a space between the target and the first relator.

With a example the rules become obvious:
```
obj
  .a = 0
  .b
  .c = 2
```

This is read as:
* declare tree literal with name `obj`
* add child to `obj` of `.` relation with name `a` then define as `0`
* add child to `obj` of `.` relation with name `b`
* add child to `obj` of `.` relation with name `c` then define as `2`

is equivalent to when grouped under a relator:
```
obj
  .
    a = 0
    b
    c = 2
```

This is read as:
* declare tree literal with name `obj`
* add child to `obj` of `.`
* add child to `.` with name `a` and define as `0`
* add child to `.` with name `b`
* add child to `.` with name `c` and define as `2`

is equivalent to inline:
```
obj .a = 0, .b, .c = 2
```

### Path
One aspect that's unique to relators is that they're used to create paths in order to:
* define data
* abstacts over concepts like file and network paths
* traverse data structure

Consider a slightly more complex example which uses both the `.` (object-property) and `:` (data-metadata) relators:
```
o
  .a = 0
  .b
    :x = 1
    :y = 2
  .c = 3
```

Using paths we can access and define this data in multiple ways. Syntactically paths acts more like other languages and uses the relator as a delimiter.

For example, to select `x` in `o` we write:
```
o.b:x
```
which is read as:
* access `o` name
* access `.` relation in `o`
* access `b` name in `.` relation
* access `:` relation in `b`
* access `x` name in `:` relation
* select name `b`

By default, selecting a value will return it's result.

It's also useful in when paired with equals syntax:
```
o.b:x = 3
```
This is read the same as the previous example however the final step will assign `3` to `x`.

Using paths we can also change how we define data. Consider an alternative way to define the above example:
```
o.
  a = 0
  b:
    x = 1
    y = 2
  c = 3
```

This is slightly more terse than the previous, structural representation as each of the common paths (`o.` and `b:`) are used. Although there's not much difference in this case; the usefulness is more pronounced in data which have deeply nested structure.

### Example - Deeply Nested Element
A more realistic example is to browse to HTML element we're concerned with and work w/n that scope:
```
html
  body
    header
      .
        style
        .
          css
            .
              width  = 100%
              height = 20px
```
Notice that there's lots of extra structure to get to the real work of setting `width` and `height` which is the purpose of this block.

Using paths we can do better and remove most of the syntactical noise:
```
html/body/header.style.css.
  width  = 100%
  height = 20px
```
We use paths to collapse the heirarchy from above to what we really are concerned about.

## Parentheses
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although we strive for tersness, parentheses are essential. Parentheses are unique in that they are used within the syntax and grammar but they are not data. Instead, they are to be used to provide information to a developer, compiler, and structure data/code but are not data themselves. This makes them very useful to be a zero cost way to group data.

Let's start with a simple example where we want to relate `x` and the sequence `a, b, c` you may expect something like this to work:
```
x = a, b, c
```
This doesn't work like you expect because the precedence of `=` is higher than `,`.

This means it is interpreted as:
```
x = a
b
c
```

To get what we want we have to add parentheses to alter the precedence:
```
x = (a, b, c)
```
An important point is that the `()` don't make `a, b, c` a sequence, the `,` does. Instead, the `()` alters the precedence my making `a, b, c` into a group.

Parentheses perform multiple duties depending on how they're used using our current syntax:
* Like in most languages they're the highest precedence:
  * infix operator `x = (1, 2, 3)`
* Is the start `(` and stop `)` of an operator, relator, function, etc.:
  * relator data definition `o.(a, b = 1, c)` or `o .(a, b = 1, c)`
  * relator selection `o.(a, b, c)`

The underlying pattern of parentheses is that they:
* group their contents together
* depending on how they used, the effect varies (eg `o.(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)` means something different than `x = (1, 2, 3)` but the pattern is the same of grouping their contents together)

[//]: # (Unlike most languages, nothing is automatically dropped or reduced. Instead, certain usages, operators, and functions have consistent rules as to how they reduce. This is slightly more complex than automatically dropping everything but it also allows it to be better represent both data and code.)

### Example - Common Structure

Consider an example which has common structure:
```
o
  .
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = 3
  :
    x = 4
    y = 5
    z = 6
```

Using our existing syntax we can represent this inline as a literal but it's rather noisy:
```
o .a = 1, .b = 2, .c = 3, :x = 4, :y = 5, :z = 6
```

Using parentheses we can express this in multiple forms which more clearly expresses the natural structure of the data. As a multiline literal:
```
o
  .(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
  :(x = 4, y = 5, z = 6)
```

as a inline literal:
```
o .(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3), :(x = 4, y = 5, z = 6)
```

or as a inline chain:
```
o.(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3):(x = 4, y = 5, z = 6)
```

### Example - Sequence of Sequences

With our current syntax we don't have a clear way to represent something like a sequence of sequences:
```
x =
  a, b, c
  d, e, f
  j, k, l
```

Since inline sequences (like `a, b, c`) are higher precedence than `\n` siblings this represents a sequence of multiple sequences.
Multiline precedence is done this way as it follows the natural English reading order top-to-bottom then left-to-right.
We want our syntax 

If we wanted to represent this inline it's now possible using parentheses:
```
x = ( (a, b, c), (d, e, f), (j, k, l) )
```

Remember that parentheses are not data (unlike lists). Instead, the parentheses indicate the grouping and precedence we want to describe.

### Example - HTML Generation

Parentheses especially help when combining multiple relators to describe more complex structure. Consider the template psuedo code:
```
div .(id = "intro", class = "spashscreen", style.css.(width = 100%, height = 20px)), :visible-if = "is-first-view"
  h1 .class = "title"
  p .class = "description"
```

using a theoretical HTML generator this would translate to:
```
<div id = "intro" class = "spashscreen" data-visible-if = "is-first-view">
  <h1 class = "title"></h1>
  <p class = "description"></p>
</div>
```
Notice that `:visible-if` is an example of a field used for logic in a template. It could either be rendered w/n the HTML (as above) or erased at comptime depending on the use-case.

This syntax is much closer to what we see in languages that model trees directly such as: SDLang, YAML, Pug, SASS. To compact the syntax further syntax sugar and macros should be used although they outside the scope of this document.

### Example - Terse HTML inline CSS

Consider a use-case where we want to model a HTML element w/ inline CSS.

Implicitly create `.style.css` structure as they're necessary steps for valid HTML:
```
// As a multiline literal
my-element
  .style.css.
    width  = 100%
    height = 20px

// or, as a multiline literal w/ '.' ending
my-element
  .style.css
    .width  = 100%
    .height = 20px

// or, as a multiline literal w/ fully collapsed context
my-element.style.css.
  width  = 100%
  height = 20px

// or, as inline literal (notice space between head and relator '.')
my-element .style.css.width = 100%, .style.css.height = 20px

// or, as assignment (no space)
my-element.style.css.width  = 100%
my-element.style.css.height = 20px

// or, as assignment w/ selection
my-element.style.css.(width, height) = 100%, 20px
```
These variations are made available to fit various use-cases. The form which best models the data it's describing and terse should be preferred.

## Destructure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Destructuring is useful as it allows us to deal directly with the structure of data and is generally more terse.

With our current syntax the problem is that `=` is a higher precedence than `,`. This means code like:
```
x, y = 1, z
```

is intepreted as:
```
x
y = 1
z
```

not:
```
x = 1
y = z
```

Since destructuring is very common we introduce a new syntax `==` which makes it easier to express with minimal visual noise. This is nearly identical to `=` except that:
* It's relative precedence is less than `,`
  * Note: We don't support a global precedence table like many C-style languages, instead all precedence is either relative or not-defined and you must use `()`
* It groups the L-hand and R-hand into `()`. This means `a, b == x, y` is basically `(a, b) = (x, y)`

Using the new syntax, there's a few ways to make this example parse as a destructure:
* Use `()` to group children together
  ```
  (x, y) = (1, z)
  ```
  It's really only essential to group the L-hand is the R-hand can be inferred as a sequence. So, in this case, this would work as well:
  ```
  (x, y) = 1, z
  ```
  It's clear now that we mean we can to assign both values `x, y`.
* Use `==` syntax
  ```
  x, y == 1, z
  ```

### Nested Destructure

Consider a slightly more complex example with nested destructuring:
```
a, (b, c == 1, 2) == (x, y == 3, 4), z
```

which after 1 step of evaluation is:
```
a, (b = 1, c = 2) == (x = 3, y = 4), z
```

after another step:
```
(a, b = 1, c = 2) = (x = 3, y = 4, z)
```

finally evaluates to:
```
(a, b = 1, c = 2) = (x = 3, y = 4, z)
```

## 6 Common Patterns
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point we've introduced all the basic syntax needed to describe the most common syntactical patterns that arise. These aren't exhaustive but they cover most of the common use-cases.

### Multiline Literal

Useful to model complex data it is most explicit and verbose. 

Multiline literals can only be embedded within other multiline literals as it's the only pattern which uses multiple lines.

```
x = 0
  .a = 1
  .b = 2
  .c
  :d = 3
y
z
  .e = 4
```

The example reads as:
* `x, y, z` are siblings
* `x` has a property relator `.` with children `a, b, c`
* `x` has a metadata relator `:` with child `d`
* `z` has a property relator `.` with child `e`

### Inline Literal

Useful to model moderately complex data which is tree-like elements like HTML, CSS, etc.

Technically it's possible to have multiple inline elements on the same line but it comes much harder to understand and thus not recommended.

```
x .a = 1, .b = 2, .c, :d = 3
  y .a, .b, :c = 1
```

or equivalently:
```
x .(a = 1, b = 2, c), :(d = 3)
  y .(a, b), :(c = 1)
```

The example reads as:
* `x` has a property relator `.` with children `a, b, c`
* `x` has a metadata relator `:` with child `d`
* `y` is the child of `x`
* `y` has a property relator `.` with children `a, b`
* `y` has a metadata relator `:` with child `c`


### Chain

Useful to model nested structure as this more easily composes within other expressions.

For example, can used to mimic syntax like `x:Int = 4` which we approximate w/ our current syntax as `x:(type = Int) = 4`

```
x.(a = 1, b = 2, c):(d = 3) = 0
```

The example reads as:
* `x` has a property relator `.` with children `a, b, c`
* `x` has a metadata relator `:` with child `d`
* `x` is bound to value `0`

### Selection

Useful to traverse and select multiple names which are then often used in other patterns.

```
x.(a, b, c):(d), z.e
```

The example reads as:
* under `x` name and then property relator `.` select names `a, b, c`
* under `x` name and then metadata relator `:` select name `d`
* under `z` name and then property relator `.` select name `e`

This selection is translated to `(x.a, x.b, x.c, x:d, z.e)`.

Selection only returned the deepest names of a structure. If you want to pass higher level names (like `x` in the above example) they need to be listed as well. For example `x, x.(a, b, c):(d), z.e` would translate to `(x, x.a, x.b, x.c, x:d, z.e)`.

### Destructure

Destructure is a combination of selection on the L-hand and values on the R-hand. The L-hand is interpreted as a sequence of names and the R-hand as a sequence of values.

Useful to model multiple return values, build data in a specific structure, define multiple names at once, handle multiple return values, etc.

```
x.(a, b, c):(d), z.e == 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

The example reads as:
* under `x` name and then property relator `.` select names `a, b, c`
* under `x` name and then metadata relator `:` select name `d`
* under `z` name and then property relator `.` select name `e`
* in order of selected, assign sequence of values `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`

For clarity, this is translates to:
```
(x.a, x.b, x.c, x:d, z.e) = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
```

### Sequence of Expressions

Useful to model internals of an expression, relator, etc. as it describes multiple names and their values.

Consider this valid, but overly confusing, example:
```
x = 0, y, z.a = 2
```

The example reads as:
* `x, y, z` are siblings
* `x` is bound to value `0`
* `z` has a property relator `.` with child `a`. `a` is bound to value `2`.

This is equivalent to the much more clear:
```
x = 0
y
z.a = 2
```

The inline form is more clear when describing the internal structure of a name. Consider if the above example is a child of relator like:
```
o.(x = 0, y, z.a = 2)
```

This is more clear as the series of expressions describe the properties of `o` and syntactically looks like the attributes of `o`.

### Orthogonal Syntax

Syntax patterns generally fall into one of two goals:
* Describing internal structure of a name (multiline literal, inline literal, chain)
* Describing multiple names regardless if they belong to a common parent (selection, destructure, sequence of expressions)

The goals are separate so that it's easier to compose data without worrying about the internal structure of a name.

To keep them mostly orthogonal, we introduce a rule which we'll explore with examples below. The rule is: ***if assigning values to names within a parent name, only the parent will be exposed to the outside.***

Here's a simple example:
```
x.(a = 1) = 0
```
If the L-hand expression `x.(a = 1)` returned `x.a` this would result in `x.a = 1` then `x.a = 0`. `x.a` being overwritten on the R-hand value is rarely, if ever, what is desired. Often we want to ignore the internal structure of `x`.

Instead this expands to:
```
x = 0
  .a = 1
```


Although the previous example may be simple to reason about, it becomes harder to visually track as the syntax becomes more complex:
```
x, y.(a, b:(t = 1), c == 1, 2, 3), z == 4, 5, 6
```

Although not recommended, this syntax is valid. Due to our rule above, we can simplify this somewhat and read it as 2 expressions:
* Ignore the internal structure of `b`
  ```
  a, b:(...), c == 1, 2, 3
  ```
* Ignore the internal structure of `y`
  ```
  x, y.(...), z == 4, 5, 6
  ```
Althought not perfect, ignoring the internal structure makes it easier to read which names are mapped to which values.

If we instead wanted to model using destructuring it is a bit more verbose but at least it's using a flat list which may be preferable in some cases:
```
x, y, y.a, y.b, y.b:t, y.c, z == 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 6
```

or equivalently (which keeps more of the structure):
```
x, y, y.(a, b, b:t, c), z == 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 6
```

Even better is representing the data as a multiline literal (which should preferred for complex syntax):
```
x = 4
y = 5
  .a = 1
  .b = 2
    :t = 1
  .c = 3
z = 6
```

### Selection ignores parents

When selection syntax is used, notice that only the bottom children names are selected. Consider the example:
```
x.(a, b:(t, u, v), c)
```

this will expand to:
```
(x.a, x.b:t, x.b:u, x.b:v, x.c)
```

This should be read as a sequence of names `(a, t, u, v, c)` and the paths required to get to them.

You can pass the names which are used for structure they have to be passed as well. Let's edit this example to pass `x` as well:
```
(x, x.(a, b:(t, u, v), c))
```

this will expand to:
```
(x, x.a, x.b:t, x.b:u, x.b:v, x.c)
```

To change this example to focus on data definition instead of data selection; simply assign any name within the structure a value:
```
x.(a, b:(t, u = 1, v), c)
```

This changes the pattern from **selection** to **chain** b/c we're defining internal structure which hides all the interals of `x` until after this expression.

## Comments
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is only one syntax for comments `//`.

Like most design choices, this syntax serves multiple purposes and is done for consistency across codebases to avoid inconsequential variants.

Comments are data and are parsed. This means they are machine parsable and can be used for generating documentation.

Comments function in multiple ways:
* Comments a line
  ```
  // My header
  div .class = header main
  ```
* Inline comment
  ```
  div
    .class = header //( My header ) main
  ```
  Notice how parentheses follow the pattern of start/stop throughout the syntax including comments
* Comments until the end of a line
  ```
  div 
    .class       = header main // My main header
    .style.width = 100%        // Full width
  ```
* Block comments
  ```
  // My Notes
    Notes both ignore the end of a line and it's children.
    So these are part of the comment as well.
  ```

Comments are data just like the rest of the syntax and makes them machine parsable.

## Escape
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only escape character is `\`.

It can be used in multiple ways:
* Escapes a single character after it
  ```
  Hello\tWorld\n
  ```
* Including escaping whitespace
  ```
  my\ complex\ name = 1
  ```
* Using parentheses will escape the contents of the parentheses. It can be used to interpolate:
  ```
  name = Jane

  "Hello \(name)!"
  ```
  and expressions:
  ```
  x = 1
  y = 2

  "x + y is \(x + y)"
  ```

## Summary of Base Syntax
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is all the syntax we need to express the base of the Elder syntax which is required for all implementations.

The base syntax is at the level of S-expressions but doesn't really have a concept of literals, types, evaluation, etc. Instead it's all about the structure and requires implementors to have their own concepts if they use this level.

If they want to rely on Elder syntax more and model languages like JSON, YAML, and many others we'll need to add more concepts. The first we use to extend the syntax is literals.

## Types
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguably the most common way to describe metadata about your program is using Types. Most languages differentiate between concepts like interfaces, abstract classes, classical types, traits, etc. In Elder, they're all just different ways to describe metadata about some data.

The metadata relator `:` allows the developer to define whatever metadata constructs they find useful. However types get special treatement as they're so widely used and useful.

### Type Sugar

Lets start simple with an example:
```
x:(type = Int) = 4
```
A few notes:
* A types is literally named `type` under the metadata relator `:`. This acts-like a keyword which has a common meaning.
* Types start with upper-case alphabetic character. This is actually the only requirement for type identifiers.

Since defining types is so common we support sugar to minimize the syntactical noise:
```
x:Int = 4
```
This only works for identifiers which can be interpreted as a types (meaning starting with upper-case alphabetic character) and is under the metadata relator `:`.

It's still possible to add more metadata:
```
x:(Int, min = 0, max = 10) = 4
```

or the equivalent expanded form:
```
x:(type = Int, min = 0, max = 10) = 4
```

It is a syntax error to set both the `type` and use the shorthand together like:
```
x:(Int, type = Float) = 4
```

### Refinement

Refinements has been carried over from Rebol and is idiomatic in Elder syntax. Refinements reuse identifiers not only to refer to the value itself but acts as a namespace.

Consider the natural heirarchy of describing positive, natural numbers:
```
Numeric        // All numbers
  Integral     // Whole numbers
    Natural    // Positive whole numbers including 0
      Positive // Positive whole numbers
```

Here all types `Numeric`, `Integral`, `Natural`, and `Positive` are all valid types and it's common to use them separately or in order to disambiguate using as a refinement:
```
a:Numeric/Integral/Natural/Positive = 4
b:Positive                          = 4
c:Positive                          = 4.0
d                                   = 4
```
A few notes:
* `a` is fully qualified 
* `b` is inferred as both `Positive` from the type and the value is `Int`. Combining both it is decidable as the same types as `a:type`
* `c` is inferred as both `Positive` from the type and the value is `Float`. Combining both it is decidable as the type is `Numeric/Float/Positive`
* `d` doesn't have a type specifier but it's value is `Int`. Since we don't have any more information it's type is as inferred as `Int`



### Reserved Types Names

There are reserved types names which are used to represent common types. They are reserved to assure they have a common meaning across implementations.

* Numeric
  * Integral
  * Floating Point
  * Fixed Point
  * Ratio
  * 
* Container
  * List-like
    * Array
    * Set
    * 
  * Map-like
    * HashMap
    * 

If an implementation doesn't natively support the type then there's a few ways to configure how the environment responds:
* When possible, emulate the type
* Default to a more general type
* Throw a compile time error on use

## Literals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Literals represent the most common data and types used by many languages which:
* are the default interpretation of data
  * The interpretation can change in different contexts like specific file types, within a Type, etc.
* are sugar which must delegate to a specific implementation
  * For example, a list literal may be implemented as LinkedList, ArrayList, C-like array, or many other choices

TODO:
* Different interpretation based on count?
  * eg arity of 1, 2, 3, ... of chars:
    * `[`
    * `{`
    * `|`
    * `"`
      * `"` inline
        * what about if EOL reached?
      * `""` operator like? ignore single leading space until first chars
        * eg `"" Some sample words` becomes `"Some sample words"`
      * `"""` block
    * `` ` ``
* Unbalaned which terminate at end of line or allow children
  * Valid for containers
    * Including parens?
  * 
* Empty concepts are stored as a meta concept which adapts to each type?
  * eg `EMPTY` identifier is type specific? for `[` it's `[]` while for `{` it's `{}` while for `"` it's empty string?
  * really concepts like EMPTY
* 

Literals are divided into a few major categories:
* Constants
  * Zero is all of these `ZERO, 0, -0`
  * PI
* Meta ???
  * IDENT ???
    * Type and operator specific?
  * NONE or EMPTY ???
    * Type and operator specific?
  * NIL ???
    * Type and operator specific?
* Error/Invalid?
  * `-0`
  * `--#`
  * `# / 0`
* Primitives
  * Numeric contains all the differerent types of number literals
    * Consistent across types
      * Positive and negative are differentiated by a `-` in front of the numeric value.
      * Commas are allowed to indicate large numbers as long as no spaces like `1000000` and `1,000,000` are read as 1 million
    * Categories (only positive examples for clarity)
      * Integer like `0,  3, 1024, 1,000,000`
      * Floating Point like `0.25, 7.18, 4.5182155354352`
      * Fixed Point
        * TODO: range + (delta or digits)
      * Ratio like `3 / 8`, `9 / 2', '1027 / 982`, `3.289 / 7.12465`
        * Ratios are not automatically reduced
        * Decimal ratios will be made into Integer values like `3.289 / 7.12465` becomes `328900 / 712465`
      * Radix
      * Scientific
        * TODO: 10e6
      * 
* Containers
  * List `[]` interprets it's children as series of entries
    * `[ a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ]` is interpreted as 3 entries of expressions
  * Map `{}` interprets it's children as a series of entries which contain a key and optional value
    * `{a = 1, b = 2, c = 3}` is interpreted as 3 entries of expressions of keys `(a, b, c)` and values `(1, 2, 3)`
    * ??? names w/o values are interpreted as just keys? w/ what value? Depends on type and DSL???
  * Inline String `"` interprets it's content as a series of characters
    * `"a = 1, b = 2, c = 3"` is interpreted as a series of characters
    * Doesn't span multiple lines
  * Inline code `` ` `` interprets it's content as unevaluated code
    * `` `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3` `` is interpreted as unevaluated code of a sequence `(a, b, c)`
    * Doesn't span multiple lines
  * Block String `"""` interprets it's children as a String separated by `\n`
    * The leading whitespace to the first child is ignored as leading space for each child to keep the formatting clean
    * Consider the block String:
      ```
      """
        a = 1
        b = 2
        c = 3
      ```
      this is equivalent to the inline form:
      ```
      "a = 1\nb = 2\nc = 3"
      ```
      Notice that the elements are separated by newlines and the leading space for each child is ignored.
  * Block code ```` ``` ```` interprets it's children as unevaluated code

## Types are a Interpretation Context
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since everything in Elder syntax is a tree, there needs to be a way to determine how a tree is interpreted. Files, Types, Blocks, along with many other constructs define the default way their children (which comprise a tree) are interpreted. For convenience, we term the default way of interpreting a tree as a new interpretation context.

A simple example is the difference between the interpretation between a `List` and a `Map`. Consider the block which will be the body of both containers:
```
a = 1
b
c = 3
```
By itself, this is interpreted as a sequence of 3 items `a, b, c` with `a` assigned to `1` and `c` assigned to `3`.

When used within a type it provides context to how interpret the sequence:
```
my-list = [
  a = 1
  b
  c = 3

my-map = {
  a = 1
  b
  c = 3
```

JS-like?
```
let myList = [ 1, null, 3 ];

let myMap = { a: 1, b: null, c: 3 };
```

My like before, `my-list` interprets the body as a list of 3 items. The only difference is it's stored within a shared data container of a `List`.
However, the `my-map` interprets the body as 3 items each of which is a key-value entry.
