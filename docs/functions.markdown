Functions are the fundamental means of computation in Elder. What's unique is:
* more details you're able to specify which are assumed, or ignored, in most languages
* the amount of control provided to the developer
* the amount of context provided to the developer to allow them to make better decisions
  * this is especially important as functions are often run from multiple contexts and are abstracted away from the contextual details. This is sometimes desirable but are sometimes needed to make smarter choices.
* multiple ways to generate and select the implementing function
