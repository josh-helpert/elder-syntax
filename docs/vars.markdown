Scratch:
* Vars are a combination of a name and a value (ie a symbol)
* Names have specific concerns like:
  * introduce/declaration
    * where and extent it's defined
    * limits of visiblity
  * shadow
    * transfer to local
    * unique to where (file, program, scope, type, ctx, match)
  * const/immutable
    * transitivity? a la D?
    * temporary/view vs permenant constraint?
  * mutate
  * count
  * forget
  * redefine
  * how/mechanisms names relate to value
    * eg spread
  * dissallowed, reserved, special names
  * syntax allowed for name
  * when a name relates to a value
    * eg undefined
    * eg delayed definition
  * initial value
  * 
* ideas
  * names under or w/n data
  * name oriented
  * name of names?
  * alias
  * meta processing w/ names
  * keyword/special names
    * eg w/n a loop name for iteration
  * programmatic processing with names?
    * just metaprogrammming w/ names?
  * include/exclude names
    * eg capture
    * eg isolated computation fn
  * special associations
    * eg bind
      * this is really a type of relation like `x <= y` or something to indicate `x` tracks value of `y`
    





Variables are a unit of memory. Variables always have a name and refer to a memory location.
